# Blockchain Block Reaction System

A TypeScript application that monitors blockchain blocks via WebSocket and measures transaction confirmation times. The system watches for new blocks, sends transfer transactions, and tracks how many blocks it takes for each transaction to be confirmed.

## Features

-   üîå **WebSocket Block Monitoring**: Real-time block notifications via WebSocket
-   ‚è≠Ô∏è **Smart Block Skipping**: Skips initial blocks via WebSocket to establish consistent connection
-   üí∏ **Automatic Transactions**: Sends transfer transactions on new block detection
-   ‚õΩ **Gas Data Caching**: Pre-fetches and caches gas data for instant transaction sending
-   üìä **Confirmation Metrics**: Tracks blocks to confirmation and timing data
-   üîÑ **Reconnection Logic**: Automatic WebSocket reconnection on disconnection
-   üõ°Ô∏è **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper cleanup and shutdown handling with Ctrl+C support

## Usage

### WebSocket Version (Recommended)

#### Development Mode
```bash
npm run dev
```

#### Production Build
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### HTTP RPC Version (Alternative)

#### Development Mode
```bash
npm run dev:http
```

#### Production Build
```bash
npm run build
npm run start:http
```

### Clean Build

```bash
npm run clean
npm run build
```

## How It Works

1. **Initialization**: The system pre-fetches gas data and starts WebSocket monitoring immediately
2. **WebSocket Connection**: Connects to the blockchain WebSocket endpoint and subscribes to new block notifications
3. **Block Skipping**: The first N blocks (configurable) are skipped to establish a consistent connection
4. **Block Detection**: When a new block is detected after the skip period, the system immediately sends a transfer transaction using cached gas data
5. **Transaction Monitoring**: Continuously monitors pending transactions for confirmation
6. **Metrics Collection**: Records confirmation times, block counts, and gas usage
7. **Summary Report**: Provides detailed analysis of all transaction confirmations

### Gas Data & Nonce Caching

The system implements intelligent caching to minimize transaction latency:

-   **Pre-fetching**: Gas data and nonce are fetched when the service starts
-   **Gas Caching**: Gas prices are cached for 30 seconds to avoid repeated API calls
-   **Nonce Caching**: Nonce values are cached for 1 minute with local incrementation
-   **Background Refresh**: Both gas data and nonce are automatically refreshed every 20 seconds
-   **Instant Transactions**: New blocks trigger immediate transactions using cached data

### Smart Block Skipping

Instead of waiting for blocks to arrive, the system:

-   **Immediate Start**: Begins WebSocket monitoring right away
-   **Skip Logic**: Counts and skips the first N blocks (configurable via `INITIAL_BLOCKS_TO_SKIP`)
-   **Efficient Processing**: Only processes blocks after the skip period
-   **Real-time Monitoring**: No delays or polling - pure WebSocket-based monitoring

### Transaction Management

The system ensures precise transaction control:

-   **Pre-send Validation**: Checks transaction count before sending (not after confirmation)
-   **Immediate Counting**: Increments counter as soon as transaction is sent
-   **No Over-sending**: Stops sending when limit is reached, regardless of confirmation status
-   **Status Tracking**: Provides real-time counts of sent vs. confirmed transactions

### Graceful Shutdown

The system handles shutdown signals properly:

-   **First Ctrl+C**: Gracefully stops the service and waits for pending transactions
-   **Second Ctrl+C**: Force exits the application
-   **Automatic Exit**: Exits automatically when all transactions are completed
-   **Auto-completion**: Process terminates automatically after showing final summary

### WebSocket vs HTTP RPC Versions

The system provides two implementations for different use cases:

#### WebSocket Version (`npm run dev` / `npm start`)
-   **Real-time**: Instant block notifications via WebSocket
-   **Efficient**: No polling, pure event-driven
-   **Low Latency**: Minimal delay between block detection and transaction
-   **Network**: Requires WebSocket support from RPC provider

#### HTTP RPC Version (`npm run dev:http` / `npm run start:http`)
-   **Universal**: Works with any HTTP RPC endpoint
-   **Polling**: Checks for new blocks every 1 second
-   **Compatible**: Works with networks that don't support WebSocket
-   **Configurable**: Adjustable polling interval and block confirmation delay

### Auto-Exit Behavior

The system automatically exits when all transactions are completed:

-   **Immediate Detection**: Recognizes completion as soon as last transaction is confirmed
-   **Summary Display**: Shows final transaction confirmation summary
-   **Graceful Exit**: Automatically terminates process after 3 seconds
-   **No Manual Intervention**: Runs completely hands-free from start to finish

## Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling for:

-   WebSocket connection failures
-   Transaction sending errors
-   Configuration validation errors
-   Network timeouts and disconnections

## Security Considerations

-   **Private Key**: Never commit your private key to version control
-   **Environment Variables**: Use `.env` files for sensitive configuration
-   **Network Security**: Ensure your RPC endpoints are secure and trusted
-   **Gas Limits**: Set appropriate gas limits to prevent excessive spending
